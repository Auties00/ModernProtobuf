/**
 * Represents a reference to a user-defined type that has not yet been resolved to its declaration.
 * <p>
 * During parsing, when a field references a user-defined type (message, enum, or group), the parser
 * initially creates an unresolved type reference because the declaration may appear later in the file
 * or in another file. The semantic analyzer is responsible for resolving these unresolved references
 * to their actual declarations, converting them to {@link ProtobufMessageTypeReference},
 * {@link ProtobufEnumTypeReference}, or {@link ProtobufGroupTypeReference}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Unresolved type references are never attributed ({@link #isAttributed()} always returns {@code false})
 * and have an unknown Protocol Buffer type ({@link #protobufType()} returns {@link ProtobufType#UNKNOWN}).
 * </p>
 *
 * @param name the unresolved type name as it appears in the Protocol Buffer definition, must not be null
